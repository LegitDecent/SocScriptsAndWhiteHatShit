The threat scan search will scan a domain or IP through the most popular threat sources for website/ip vetting in order to use this you will need to obtain a free URLscan.io API key and insert it into the code where it says "PutYourKeyHereNerd" (there are two places where this occurs). Other than that, this should help people easily vet potentially dangerous FQDN's and IP's. Enjoy or something. This only works in linux because windoze sucks and can't use xdg-open in WSL, so don't use windoze. 

The AbuseIPDB file will search all IP's from the file located at /Scans/1.txt (these should be single IP's each on a newline). This is useful to run daily as a cronjob on a linux host to verify you don't have any host IP's you own constantly spamming the internet with dirty traffic which could be a sign of compromise. This is a purely reactionary tool and you should probably get real security and use this to verify what you are doing is working. The file violations.txt is the file you should check for any issues, if they are found idk good luck grepping the reports.txt. You could fix this and make it more clean and to report the IP with the reports per host, but that seems annoying and I don't really care that much. As with the last one you need an API key from AbuseIPDB this is free for up to 600 IP's a day place it where it says "PutYourKeyHereNerd".
