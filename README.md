The threat scan search will scan a domain or IP through the most popular threat sources for website/ip vetting in order to use this you will need to obtain a free URLscan.io API key and insert it into the code where it says "InsertYouApiKeyHereNerd" (there are two places where this occurs). Other than that, this should help people easily vet potentially dangerous FQDN's and IP's. Enjoy or something.
